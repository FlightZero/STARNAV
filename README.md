# Space-Travel-Script-System
a connected system of scripts for use in kOS, a Kerbal Space Program mod
for KSP v 1.1 and kOS v 0.20.0

#Intent
As my first foray into kOS, this will be centralized place to store, update and share my kOS programs.

#Design Principles
1. Modular: scripts are re-usable, may be combined, or used alone.
2. Design-agnostic: scripts are designed with maximum flexibility with regards to vehicle design. They should work with any craft which is nominally capable of executing the mission. 
3. Accessible: code is well-formatted and commented. Comments are written in plain language and clearly communicate intent at every step.
4. Ethical: inspiration is aknowledged with links.
